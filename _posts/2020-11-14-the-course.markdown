The course of things is such that what was in front is now behind. Everyday you embark on a journey of your own, with a different mindset each day. A new day brings with it a bag full of unseen challenges that calls for a distinct persona. There’s an ecosystem that exists in every person’s life encompassing various aspects like spiritual, behavioural, social, mental and many more. All these facets coalesce in disparate forms that lets us pave our days.  

I captured this picture of a fitting path situated on the top of an adjacent floodgate of a reservoir in South India. Around the time of sunset, the green grass turned golden and I couldn’t resist capturing such a serene view. Every human has walked their course of journey to get where they are now, yet they still have a lot to cover in their life’s expedition. Each crossroad gives you an opportunity to pick where you wish to head, which essentially is the reason why you are where you are right now. 

But where is this manoeuvre taking you to? Perhaps towards the realization of that one end goal or a dream that has been on your mind since forever. There are some things that fuel the purpose of one’s life and somewhere none of us know what we would do once they are all achieved.

So all we’re left with is The Course of our life and faith in how far we can go in the incertitude of traversing through the unforeseen path.
