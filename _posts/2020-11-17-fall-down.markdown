It is improbable to find a living being who wouldn’t be enthralled by the cotton-like miracle that floats overhead in this big blue blanket. Watching clouds can either make a person feel tiny or enormous or both. How wonderfully and diversely the souls of clouds speak to the souls of humans, for as long as the Earth has existed. Just like everyone else who has an opinion about the sky’s cotton, I too have an intangible affinity towards them. This is the last picture that I could take of the sky where the clouds looked up to me, and not the other way around. That’s right, mankind had just struck with the bolt of this miniscule organism that has managed to make every aspect of our existence fall down.

> Ring-a-round the rosie,
A pocket full of posies,
Ashes! Ashes!
We all fall down.
 

Possibly the most darkest children’s rhyme that has existed ever since the Great Plague. I find it difficult to ascertain the differences between the plague that gave us a dicey poem from the plague that has diced out the life of humans. This dark patch of cloud awaits for its own silver lining. 

Somehow the clouds complete the sky, just like despair completes hope.
